# React + Vite + TypeScript Project

This is a modern development setup using Vite for fast development, and TypeScript for type safety. This project serves as a template to quickly get started with a front-end development environment optimized for React (or other frameworks) with unit tests.

## Features

- Vite for fast bundling and development
- TypeScript for type safety and better tooling
- React

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (>= 14.x.x)
- npm or yarn package manager

## Installation

## Development

### Starting the Development Server

To run the app in development mode, simply run:

```js

### Building the Project

To create a production build of the project, run:

```js
yarn build
```

This will create an optimized build in the dist/ folder.
